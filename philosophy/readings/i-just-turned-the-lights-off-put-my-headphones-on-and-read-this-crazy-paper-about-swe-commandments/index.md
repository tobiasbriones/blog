# I Just Turned the Lights Off, Put My Headphones On and Read This Crazy Paper About SWE Commandments

I just turned the lights off, put my headphones on, and read this crazy
paper:
[Programming the Universe: The First Commandment of Software Engineering for all
Varieties of Information Systems](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1609/1609.07818.pdf).

## Context

I've been devising axiomatization and philosophies almost since I started
studying math back in ~2017 (I already knew a lot about programming in
general/practice), that's when I invented Piaxid ðŸ¥°. Ever wondered why I
recently founded mathematical software engineering?. It's a self-employed
undertaking I've taken, consisting of many years of dedication to build results
to make formal sense of everything.

I found this paper today and seemed interesting to review. 

I found it when I was validating (as usual) my central principles
about merging math as the *universal language* into software as *a universe*
(since you can reify real-world systems into software). I mean, math is
a universe and software too, then *math software* is a **unique** cohesive 
whole, and that's why I chose **math** and **software** together as my
specialization and life project after validating many things like my skills I
had developed for years even before the university.

In short, I was searching for interesting stuff and found this paper, so I 
read it and shared it in this article.
