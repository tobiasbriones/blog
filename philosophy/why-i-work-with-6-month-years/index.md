# Why I Work with 6-Month Years

The simplest designs are the best, they are more suitable to be proved and
if it can be proved, then we have math. Something simple like a recursive
logic that maps to a universe set a single value like 1 in the base step.

## Easy Does Not Necessarily Equal Simple

The easiest designs are monoliths with primitive obsession, but the simplest 
designs are devised in a case by case basis. So easy designs are bad but easy 
for the practitioner to come up with whilst simple designs are the best -as
they're easier to formally state- but hard for the practitioner to obtain.

Even in chaotic systems or stochastic processes we're interested in 
*modeling* simple equations even when they're no deterministic, but simple
linear models can be used to solve the problems properly rather than leveraging
complicated non-linear algebra.

Notice that in engineering we *design* unlike math where we *model*.
