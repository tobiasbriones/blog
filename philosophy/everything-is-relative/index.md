# Everything is Relative

Your life is going to change like mine did when you truly understand that
everything is relative.

I used to see everything as absolute, now I can see relativism after years of
math, engineering, and philosophy.

This is too heavy thus I will only provide a simple idea.

I design modules and trees. What are low-level and high-level?

Everything is a domain, homogeneity is key for pureness.

The root of a tree is not low-level or high-level as is, it depends on the
observer.

You can always take a subtree, and its root role will change.

## Absolutists are Stupid

We have that:

> **stupid:** having or showing a great lack of intelligence or common sense.

Absolutists tell you stone-written rules because they're stupid, but certainly,
*the only constant is change*, so you have to adapt to change to be intelligent
(intelligence definition apparently said by
[Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking)) so you
need to go domain specific --which is an art-- to match a case-by-case basis.
That is the opposite of absolute, *it's relative* and that's why human
common sense can only lead to wrong conclusions that are easy or absolute to
understand while in fact, *everything is relative*.

When you go domain specific you have *more information* to take more optimal
decisions in a case-by-case basis. Hence, being absolutist is nothing but plain
stupid.

## Perspective: Business vs User

The business logic can be high-level for the business but then the presentation
layer is a low-level detail.

## Scalability

If you chop a tree you still get a tree, but if you chop a pyramid it'll stop
working as they're not homogeneous.

### Scale Your Social Skills

I'm technically skilled, but I've also proved to be socially skilled by scaling
my skills horizontally.

I've been good at socializing in person with students with no technical
knowledge, they are enthusiasts or superficial instead. That's because the
underlying *domain* is the same and *scales* unlike a pyramidal-like structure
that is vertical, that is, it can't scale.

I won't want to talk to an accountant for example, but that doesn't mean I don't
have communication skills.

In other words, if you are technical excellent you must also be an excellent
communicator in THAT domain (wrongly called "manager"), yes, excellent at both.

#### Don't Grow Vertically

If you do two things but are mediocre at one, you scaled vertically. For
example, a plain engineer is a horrible scientist if they try to be one, despite
the fact that they're supposed to have an academic background.

I can mathematically show horizontal and vertical growing. It's easy, just about
vector spaces. No one has a remote idea of what I'm talking about. I use to talk
just for myself only. If they are mathematicians they suck at engineering, and
if they are engineers they suck at (everything) math.

#### Vertical Structures Can't Scale Up

If you're a mere manager or whatever unicorn-hyped buzzword made up by
capitalists, then you can't scale that skill, and you might be able to talk to
some people but nothing else, and you will never be an engineer with technical
competence. Although, being so is still part of humanity.

Or the same, an engineer can have social skills on their domain but a 
heterogeneous workaround like a boss or a manager (made-up by people or 
capitalists instead of scientific facts or direct knowledge) is just that (a 
manager) since monoliths can't scale, that's why they are monoliths and 
vertical (they fall apart). 

I say or can define vertical/monolith/pyramidal/impurities to give a precise 
representation of the abstraction of doing things wrong by employing workarounds
that bypass the real problems that actually have to be addressed with real 
science and facts instead of made-up buzzwords. 

Why do you think companies only last one or two centuries at best while 
science, math and engineering are always universal (mostly math)?

## Heterogeneous Systems are Not Needed

Therefore, capitalism, universities, and all those archaic hierarchies of power
are evil and unnecessary, can you see the abstraction I inferred?.

Therefore, we don't need buzzwords like Managers, SCRUM, Startups, OOP jungle of
patterns, there's a lot to elaborate on this (workarounds).

We need autonomous engineers where some will be the root of technical domains
and others will be skilled in the root of people domains smoothly following the
dependency/domain tree.

Many can say that "capitalist/OOP works or does great things" but that's 
because it can be sold but not proven. We can do much better by being more 
homogeneous. In the beginning of my entrepreneurship endeavour I used to think 
about building commercial companies (hence by those mindsets I used to think 
more absolutely), but after learning a lot, that's the last move I want to do. 
Money and impurities are imminent out there, but as I said, we can be more 
homogeneous to do much better.

### Humans are Not Needed

Manual manpower was required in the past century when computers (useful 
computers we know today) and globalization didn't exist. Now most of the 
manual work made by humans is done by machines, but also better done since 
*humans themselves are just another workaround* who have to evolve to get rid 
of themselves. 

Think of human stages, times are completely different, so it reminds of the 
[Rust compiler that is written in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler)
--a general-purpose language has to be built in itself-- and has to get rid of 
itself in order to evolve.

In the long run, you can't even compare an old version of human or programming 
language to a modern version. *The only constant is change* so that leads us 
to be domain-specific to be able to be at top of evolution by accurately 
defining what we need for our purpose of life.

Manual manpower was mostly deprecated long ago, now, traditional corporations 
with remarkable vertical hierarchies (they're literally superior to you 
according to them) are being suppressed by startups which have better 
structures that are more homogeneous but still full of buzzwords. Will 
managers/bosses/teachers/coaches/mediators/... be next to be 
deprecated? I don't think so as humans are stupid enough to keep on the 
status quo, but in the meantime machines are evolving at a faster pace than 
human primates.

Machines are fast to evolve, as a fun advise, watch "Futurama: Evolution and 
the Missing Link".

Thus, it looks like humans are just peons of evolution doing workarounds to 
build better systems from the rules of evolution. A peon for me is an entity 
that does not satisfy its purpose of life. If you need workarounds then 
you're definitely a peon and the only way out is to be more homogeneous 
contrary to what humans are, to eventually achieve the-right-thing-right that I 
define as fulfilling the purpose of each entity.

Humans are heterogeneous by nature and work as peons or workarounds 
(otherwise life would be perfect for humans) and [heterogeneous systems are 
not needed](#heterogeneous-systems-are-not-needed) so humans are not 
required too, since a near perfect civilization will necessarily have to be
homogeneous in order to scale and so not to be human.

So humans are not needed because machines end up doing a better job, evolve 
faster, and humans who were peons can evolve into something further to optimize 
their purpose in life via human-machine composition. As you can see, 
inheritance (like the OOP way) with heterosexual reproduction was just another 
workaround, I have better ways of reproducing myself by writing formal articles
and sharing my thoughts for example, so I'll teach by giving the example (hence
I call them Example Projects). I'm pretty sure that Einstein would've thought
like that where they will remind you by your actions forever instead of just
giving birth to empty-disk temporal humans.

Sex is another stereotype and can only be used to define primitive animals but
people still classify you as "man" or "woman" as if it were inheritance. 
Here comes the common programmer advice to use composition instead of 
inheritance. Your sex is not a base class that defines you as an 
extremely-coupled vertical hierarchy, it's part of you but not "the base class".

The way how something is depends on the observer, the result of what will 
happen depends on who makes the observations, if others understand 
inheritance they will interface with you in that way, if they understand 
composition they are likely to be much clever and interface with 
mathematicians or computer scientists, you can read the
[Conway's law \| Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) 
adage to know something similar on how the way organization's products end up
being is relative to the way the underlying organization is. Their 
perception of the universe change their reality, and you decide if you want 
to see the universe the way the see it. That's why it's recommended to have 
a "positive mindset" not because it'll change the bad but because it'll 
unlock dormant parts of your body according to my own experience. So you can 
have a terrible day when it could've perfectly been a great day if you apply 
relativity and change the reality by employing a better mindset.  

A pure being does not have sex defined as it's homogeneous like a recursive 
function and composable, it "compiles itself". I can say I'm "auto sexual" as I
love myself which leads to the fact that I'm an expert at myself, so I have a
well-defined domain or purpose that can be coupled or imported into another
pure being like me but who has a different domain.

A monolith like a human or animal has to born, get old, and then die because of
their impurities that corrupt their existence. A pure being doesn't get old,
or born or die since there's no monolith that draws that energy from that 
being as I talk in 
[Why I Work with 6-Month Years](../why-i-work-with-6--month-years) explaining 
why monoliths are such a weight to hold, hence they age and eventually die or fall apart. 

Suppose there's a human who is not a peon, then that's a contradiction as 
humans are full of heterogeneity or impurities and workarounds, so they're 
peons by definition. Therefore, humans will have to evolve (and are doing it 
[^1]) via human-machine composition to achieve a more homogeneous design.

[^1]: Check [Nanobots - an overview | ScienceDirect Topics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/nanobots)

As a fun fact, I'll add here words of Zamasu that are good to contrast with
peons and mutable state (OOP): 

> ...beings living in an eternal war...
> 
> [Zamasu](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Zamasu) (Dragon Ball Super)

Imagine constantly living by workaround back and forth to keep mutable state 
and "OOP patterns" that can't be proved but only sold, you need to learn to 
do the right thing right which is an art like ultra instinct (DBS) to get 
out of that circle or "eternal war".

[Ultra instinct](https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Ultra_Instinct)
makes you move without thinking, it's not imperative where the ordinary mortal
has to think and send signals to move their muscles but declarative or
functional: the art where your body knows how to move itself declaratively. 
Your muscles know themselves and are autonomous, they go domain-specific.

### Teach Yourself

Teachers or professors are workarounds, they are seen as "superior persons"
who are supposed to "give you the knowledge", but they are just another
smell of something that is wrong.

Your brain is integrated into your system, and a human is also a monolith, so
it's even more coupled to yourself.

They teach, you have to be a "good" student and have many degrees, but that's
relative: if your university sucks then it's just in vain, and top 25
universities are an intellectual monopoly, so they're not viable options by
any mean anyway.

The only thing you can do is to *teach you about yourself*, you need to be
an expert at *yourself*. They want you to be "someone" in this life like an
engineer, doctor or lawyer, but people are stupid enough that they forget to
work on themselves first. That is key as your brain is yours and if you're
expert at yourself then you can move forward without carrying problems or 
workarounds since inception. Knowing yourself is inception of your life journey.

Hence, teachers or professors are more workarounds to sell cheap education
for cheap students even if they have "honours" diplomas.

A teacher is an entity physically far from you, so if you need a teacher to 
learn something then it means that your intelligence is *fragmented* --another
common smell of heterogeneous systems--.

External systems (managers, teachers, etc.) acting on fragmented systems
(OO programs, primitive obsession practices, students, employees, etc.) can
only indoctrinate with generic rules because they're not domain experts.

If you need a teacher then you're not learning cohesively because you're
requiring an external system to work with your brain which is already internal
and close to itself and yourself, the knowledge is worked out inside your brain 
in the end, so you have to keep highly cohesive there by learning about 
yourself and so be much more efficient.

If you are autonomous then you're the domain expert, or expert at being
yourself, at fulfilling your purpose in life or the reason you exist.

If that's not enough insight, then let's go back to the fact that a
programming language is build in itself, e.g. Rust's compiler is built on Rust.
See [Bootstrapping_(compilers) \| Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers))
for further information on this. A general-purpose language has to be an 
expert at itself, so it can compile itself and be homogeneous there, and 
also be considered a serious general-purpose programming language.

See the example I give: I work on my domain or my purpose in life, if you
find out interesting what I do then you will know how to "compile yourself"
and "import" this knowledge I write into your system to scale it 
horizontally. What I do is decoupled, it scales, you can use composition to 
take it. Universities are extremely coupled on the other hand.

In short, find what is relative/local/domain-specific/close/cohesive
/efficient instead of more absolute approaches like teachers or managers. 
The keyword is *find,* so it refers to an art of knowing it in a case-by-case 
basis. Absolute systems are easier to understand but are inherently wrong. 
Relativity is for true intellectuals as you can see.

## Final Thought

Einstein was a genius to have figured it out against what ordinary people were
programmed to think. I think he used to be high like me too, since he imagined
crazy ideas in his mind. Now we have machines in this era, and I can expand on
that idea.

I've asked myself how can I develop a step-by-step output for any arbitrary 
computation. I'd be talking here about a project I used to call Didalgoring 
Lesson (Didactic Algorithm Lesson) but I've evolved the idea after studying 
and figuring out many ways and concepts over the years. I posed these 
problems to myself, for example, when I had to teach data structures, I had 
to create the steps with Photoshop, so I needed to scale and devise that idea of 
representing any arbitrary algorithm. I certainly must be on the homogeneous
(pure/relative/simplest/functional) side to achieve the ultimate scalability in 
terms of logic.
