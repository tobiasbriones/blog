# Everything is Relative

Your life is going to change like mine did when you truly understand that
everything is relative.

I used to see everything as absolute, now I can see relativism after years of
math, engineering, and philosophy.

This is too heavy thus I will only provide a simple idea.

I design modules and trees. What are low-level and high-level?

Everything is a domain, homogeneity is key for pureness.

The root of a tree is not low-level or high-level as is, it depends on the
observer.

You can always take a subtree, and its root role will change.

## Perspective: Business vs User

The business logic can be high-level for the business but then the presentation
layer is a low-level detail.

## Scalability

If you chop a tree you still get a tree, but if you chop a pyramid it'll stop
working as they're not homogeneous.

### Scale Your Social Skills

I'm technically skilled, but I've also proved to be socially skilled by scaling
my skills horizontally.

I've been good at socializing in person with students with no technical
knowledge, they are enthusiasts or superficial instead. That's because the
underlying *domain* is the same and *scales* unlike a pyramidal-like structure
that is vertical, that is, it can't scale.

I won't want to talk to an accountant for example, but that doesn't mean I don't
have communication skills.

In other words, if you are technical excellent you must also be an excellent
communicator in THAT domain (wrongly called "manager"), yes, excellent at both.

#### Don't Grow Vertically

If you do two things but are mediocre at one, you scaled vertically. For
example, a plain engineer is a horrible scientist if they try to be one, despite
the fact that they're supposed to have an academic background.

I can mathematically show horizontal and vertical growing. It's easy, just about
vector spaces. No one has a remote idea of what I'm talking about. I use to talk
just for myself only. If they are mathematicians they suck at engineering, and
if they are engineers they suck at (everything) math.

#### Vertical Structures Can't Scale Up

If you're a mere manager or whatever unicorn-hyped buzzword made up by
capitalists, then you can't scale that skill, and you might be able to talk to
some people but nothing else, and you will never be an engineer with technical
competence. Although, being so is still part of humanity.

Or the same, an engineer can have social skills on their domain but a 
heterogeneous workaround like a boss or a manager (made-up by people or 
capitalists instead of scientific facts or direct knowledge) is just that (a 
manager) since monoliths can't scale, that's why they are monoliths and 
vertical (they fall apart). 

I say or can define vertical/monolith/pyramidal/impurities to give a precise 
representation of the abstraction of doing things wrong by employing workarounds
that bypass the real problems that actually have to be addressed with real 
science and facts instead of made-up buzzwords. 

Why do you think companies only last one or two centuries at best while 
science, math and engineering are always universal (mostly math)?

## Heterogeneous Systems are Not Needed

Therefore, capitalism, universities, and all those archaic hierarchies of power
are evil and unnecessary, can you see the abstraction I inferred?.

Therefore, we don't need buzzwords like Managers, SCRUM, Startups, OOP jungle of
patterns, there's a lot to elaborate on this (workarounds).

We need autonomous engineers where some will be the root of technical domains
and others will be skilled in the root of people domains smoothly following the
dependency/domain tree.

Many can say that "capitalist/OOP works or does great things" but that's 
because it can be sold but not proven. We can do much better by being more 
homogeneous. In the beginning of my entrepreneurship endeavour I used to think 
about building commercial companies (hence by those mindsets I used to think 
more absolutely), but after learning a lot, that's the last move I want to do. 
Money and impurities are imminent out there, but as I said, we can be more 
homogeneous to do much better.

### Humans are Not Needed

Manual manpower was required in the past century when computers (useful 
computers we know today) and globalization didn't exist. Now most of the 
manual work made by humans is done by machines, but also better done since 
*humans themselves are just another workaround* who have to evolve to get rid 
of themselves. 

Think of human stages, times are completely different, so it reminds of the 
[Rust compiler that is written in Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler)
--a general-purpose language has to be built in itself-- and has to get rid of 
itself in order to evolve.

In the long run, you can't even compare an old version of human or programming 
language to a modern version. *The only constant is change* so that leads us 
to be domain-specific to be able to be at top of evolution by accurately 
defining what we need for our purpose of life.

Manual manpower was mostly deprecated long ago, now, traditional corporations 
with remarkable vertical hierarchies (they're literally superior to you 
according to them) are being suppressed by startups which have better 
structures that are more homogeneous but still full of buzzwords. Will 
managers/bosses/teachers/coaches/mediators/... be next to be 
deprecated? I don't think so as humans are stupid enough to keep on the 
status quo, but in the meantime machines are evolving at a faster pace than 
human primates.

Machines are fast to evolve, as a fun advise, watch "Futurama: Evolution and 
the Missing Link".

Thus, it looks like humans are just peons of evolution doing workarounds to 
build better systems from the rules of evolution. A peon for me is an entity 
that does not satisfy its purpose of life. If you need workarounds then 
you're definitely a peon and the only way out is to be more homogeneous 
contrary to what humans are, to eventually achieve the-right-thing-right that I 
define as fulfilling the purpose of each entity.

## Final Thought

Einstein was a genius to have figured it out against what ordinary people were
programmed to think. I think he used to be high like me too, since he imagined
crazy ideas in his mind. Now we have machines in this era, and I can expand on
that idea.

I've asked myself how can I develop a step-by-step output for any arbitrary 
computation. I'd be talking here about a project I used to call Didalgoring 
Lesson (Didactic Algorithm Lesson) but I've evolved the idea after studying 
and figuring out many ways and concepts over the years. I posed these 
problems to myself, for example, when I had to teach data structures, I had 
to create the steps with Photoshop, so I needed to scale and devise that idea of 
representing any arbitrary algorithm. I certainly must be on the homogeneous
(pure/relative/simplest/functional) side to achieve the ultimate scalability in 
terms of logic.
