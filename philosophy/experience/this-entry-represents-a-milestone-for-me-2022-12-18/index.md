# This Entry Represents a Milestone for Me (2022/12/17)

I have to say that 
[this entry](how-i-standardized-hypen-and-pipe-symbols-on-file-names) 
represents a milestone for MathSwe content as I've started to work with the
concepts of:

- Composable entries.

- Cohesive entries.

- Smooth homogeneous content that moves on the system tree.

- Got a new open graph cover.

Homogeneous content allows me to achieve simplicity so I don't need to employ
bureaucratic/academic stereotypes like sections that are literally called "
Introduction", "Body", or "Conclusion" (heterogeneous) since I'm writing content
as it was source code, and I leverage functional programming for making informed
decisions every day.

Whenever I want to get knowledge or take decisions I only have to use my math
and functional-programming basis to infer a proper solution to each particular
problem, in other words, I only have to think to get new knowledge and answers.

Programming, engineering, math, philosophy, research, and others have
systematically structured my brain all over the years.

Functional programming, math, and relativism have shifted my personal and
professional life, and they're the ones whom I have to thank for everything I've
built up and been able to understand.
