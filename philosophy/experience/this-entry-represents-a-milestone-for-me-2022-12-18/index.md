# This Entry Represents a Milestone for Me (2022/12/18)

I have to say that
[this entry](how-i-standardized-hypen-and-pipe-symbols-on-file-names) [I
published 3 days ago](https://github.com/tobiasbriones/blog/pull/20)
represents a milestone for MathSwe content as I've started to work with the
concepts of:

- Composable entries.
- Cohesive entries.
- Smooth homogeneous content that moves on the system tree.
- Got a new open graph cover.

## Composable Entries

This powerful concept will allow readers to move over the system tree
smoothly and enable me to create unlimited scalable articles by writing
focused high-quality content that is decoupled from other topics so that
readers can use composition to deep more withing other details if needed or
just read straight ahead if not needed.

A great representation of the correctness and beauty of functional programming
and composition lies when **you take what you need and don't take what you
don't need** which is something impossible to actually do with other paradigms
(OOP, procedural, imperative, mixed, etc.).

The idea is that the system tree is informed, so we can either read just
about the underlying topic of the article or **expand within other related
content as much as needed** within an **uncoupled** (or composable) ***sum* of
highly-cohesive entries that build a greater whole**.

## Cohesive Entries

As an intellectual I always want to write about many contents I have in mind,
but for any entry I've eventually resolved to write or talk about one topic
and if details should/must be stated then draft them out and build other
entries.

Now I'm pretty careful about off-topic that must go somewhere else.

Entries must be united wholes that are about the **same** content, so we can
*sum* (scale) them up to build a greater system tree of high-quality content.
