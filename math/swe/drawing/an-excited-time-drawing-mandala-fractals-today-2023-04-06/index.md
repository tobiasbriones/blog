# An Excited Time Drawing Mandala Fractals Today (2023-04-06)

Today at this moment I was thinking about fractals and mandalas. I'm always 
thinking about these concepts, but I just got excited about it and stayed 
playing with some drawings I figured out.

It's a way to feel better, that I'm doing what I love, I just had to do it 
even though I had no agenda for that.

Among being a mathematician, engineer, philosopher, entrepreneur, and others,
being an artist who designs the meaning of all these knowledge is part of my 
stance.

I've been wanting to formalize the MathSwe logo, so it can be defined 
declaratively via recursion or an elegant equation instead of Photopea or 
raster graphics.

So, I've been playing with some recursion and fractals once in a while the 
last days.
