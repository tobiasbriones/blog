# Drawing a Sierpinski Petal Mandala Fractal in JavaFX

## Getting Started

Tools and project set up is given next, so you can build the basics for 
developing the underlying drawing in JavaFX.

First, make sure to have Java 17+ installed on your development machine. If 
you're using Linux, I recommend using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io) for
[installing Java](https://sdkman.io/usage#installdefault) and managing different
versions. If you're using Windows, you can download the
[installer from foojay.io](https://foojay.io/download).

In addition to the recommended Java installation method mentioned above, I
highly suggest using the **Zulu (FX) distribution** to get the FX mods out of
the box!

As always, I'm using IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE of choice, so next, we need to set
up the JavaFX app.

For creating a new JavaFX app, follow
[Beginning JavaFX Applications with IntelliJ IDE \| foojay.io](https://foojay.io/today/beginning-javafx-with-intellij)
with one of the approach given by the author. I suggest using the "Plain" 
approach for this project.

With this, Java and JavaFX should be available on your machine as well as the
dev tools, environment, and starting project, so we can start writing the JavaFX
code.
