# The Call to Action Boils Down to Cohesion in the End

The *call to action* boils down to cohesion in the end. Marketing, capitalist
buzzwords, and OOP always have to end up in the same fundamental principles of
FP/math/science/real-engineering.

Although buzzwords have *something helpful*: they're easy to understand for
non-geniuses or average people. In this case, for business people.

## Call to Action Design

Call to action consists of giving a clear way to the user to do what the
business wants them to do (e.g. add to cart) unlike those archaic desktop 2000s
WinXP apps with hundreds of bloated enterprise and small forms, buttons, and
options in the same window. Or bloated unresponsive websites full of options
and advertisements.

Software used to be a monolith in those archaic times of computers and
incipient programming (recall that computers were square back in the day and
everything was unclear and full of obnoxious workarounds üòÇ).

Now we have the capability to enforce better-designed systems that
are cohesive:

- üêµ do one thing (homogeneous whole) and well done, instead of

- üôà everything (a monolith) and done mediocre full of workarounds like OO
  systems.

If you present the user with a bloated app they won't focus on what to do, but
you *want them* to make sure to buy your stuff and do it right, so you maximize
your profit and also the user's effort to get value from your business.

That doesn't mean you can only put a function into a file or a button into a
screen, but instead, the same logic for a module, the same logic for a screen, 
etc.
