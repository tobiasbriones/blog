# The Call to Action Boils Down to Cohesion in the End

<strong>Call to Action</strong>

---

The *call to action* boils down to cohesion in the end. Marketing, capitalist
buzzwords, and OOP always have to end up in the same fundamental principles of
FP/math/science/real-engineering.

Although buzzwords have *something helpful*: they're easy to understand for
non-geniuses or average people. In this case, for business people.

## Call to Action Design

Call to action consists of giving a clear way to the user to do what the
business wants them to do (e.g. add to cart) unlike those archaic desktop 2000s
WinXP apps with hundreds of bloated enterprise and small forms, buttons, and
options in the same window. Or bloated unresponsive websites full of options
and advertisements.

Software used to be a monolith in those archaic times of computers and
incipient programming (recall that computers were square back in the day and
everything was unclear and full of obnoxious workarounds üòÇ).

Now we have the capability to enforce better-designed systems that
are cohesive:

- üêµ do one thing (homogeneous whole) and well done, instead of

- üôà everything (a monolith) and done mediocre full of workarounds like OO
  systems.

If you present the user with a bloated app they won't focus on what to do, but
you *want them* to make sure to buy your stuff and do it right, so you maximize
your profit and also the user's effort to get value from your business.

That doesn't mean you can only put a function into a file or a button into a
screen, but instead, the same logic for a module, the same logic for a screen,
etc.

### Understand When It's Bloated

An adult human mind can only hold 4 different things on average [1]. So, what
matters is not to limit to "one button per screen" but the same kind of
logic/interaction in one screen (scales horizontally).

*It's relative:*

- if you go to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) you
  can see a cohesive whole as the entire website and that makes sense for you
  as a user who wants to move around the website to obtain value from it, but
- if you're the programmer then the whole website is a monolith with many
  *orthogonal* concepts.

The science of this is that you have to define *homogeneous* entities or things.

The actions in the top right menu are cohesive, I can know that because
*they're close to each other*, so I expect the underlying logic to be
homogeneous too, all menu items are homogeneous or of the same type so the 
bundle of actions in the menu is cohesive.

Notice that "close" is *relative* to your metric, so you can define you 
metric space or use the Euclidean distance, now you can see why you must be 
good at math to be a good software engineer.

A small change in the input (mouse cursor or keyboard keys) produces a small 
output close to the sibling entities (menu actions) output. This *measure* of 
homogeneity is what defines the quality of the software or design of your 
system.

The art of cohesion places homogeneous entities/things close, so they can 
build a united cohesive whole. A highly cohesive system can be more 
mathematically proved whilst heterogeneous systems with orthogonal 
integrations are a complete mess.

As a side note, some people might say that there are systems where "a small 
change of the input produces a random change in the output" like chaotic 
dynamic systems, cryptography, stochastic processes, etc., but those are 
just temporal workarounds to get good-enough results faster, we want forward 
engineering here, I talk more about this in other entries like 
[everything is relative](../../philosophy/everything-is-relative).

Therefore, if you want to optimize for an action in your screen, you must 
give the clear UI/UX to the user to achieve only *that action,* so you *call 
to the action*. If you give orthogonal options to that action to the user 
then it's become a heterogeneous system and the results are more difficult 
to prove or test and the user will likely take a suboptimal decision if any at 
all.

### Marketers vs Scientist

Cohesion is one of the most important universal principles, and I teach it a
lot, as you can see, it applies to any problem, disregarding the buzzwords they
make.

OOP marketers (they're not programmers) call it SOLID, etc., but in the end,
everything formally ends up in the same scientific principles (with no marketing
buzzwords). The way they see it, is just an easier way to understand it for 
their context.

Like some say, OOP ends up much like FP when applying "OOP principles".

Imagine if real engineers like electrical/civil engineers or math software 
engineers would use cringe buzzwords fuzzy words like "WET", "YAGNI", "Tell 
Don't Ask", etc., (I don't even know/remember what they mean, and we DO NOT 
want to know either). Then now, imagine cities, electrical systems of your 
house, spacecrafts, car engines, traffic lights, etc., would be a complete mess 
developed by a chunk of stupid people unable to understand science.

It's deplorable that many "engineers" or "programmers" don't know what it 
means "DSL", and they even say that they don't care, but they obviously know 
the cringe OOP words because they're cheap programmers. It's fair if you 
don't know something but being a bottom programmer (IT labourer actually) is 
completely different. I've also explained that *everything is a language* so 
a software engineer must positively understand what "DSL" means, to then build 
homogeneous systems. 

A real engineer must understand the scientific principles of their 
engineering discipline like for example, electric charge/field for electrical 
engineers, differential equations for civil engineers, set theory for 
software engineers, etc.

## Cohesion is Universal

The dictionary states that cohesion "forms a united whole" so here your work as
an engineer is to define what the homogeneous "whole" means since everything is
relative, that is, you must remove the heterogeneity to get a cohesive "whole".
That proves that cohesion is a universal axiom of design.

Cohesion is a universal principle, it can even be proved that "lexical cohesion
is computationally feasible to identify" [2]. The education system doesn't teach
you any of these fundamental topics, they're clearly not cohesive organizations
so schools are just cheap workarounds instead of what they're supposed to be.

FP tells you *what to do* or what functions you can call, FP concepts 
also ensure to keep the logic flow cohesive. You can't call a function that 
is far away and does not make sense for the current data type. It's like a 
`Result` which can only be defined as `Ok` or `Err` so you *know what to do* 
and carry on.

## Conclusion

The call to action is a modern approach to interface with our users that helps
build cohesive flows so that the user is focused on retrieving value from our
software/products/services and the business also maximises their profit by
having more engaged users who are presented a clear way to solve their problems.

If you do it wrong, you'll bloat users with orthogonal options that only 
create an unmanageable cyclomatic complexity. So users will not even keep 
burning their heads into your platform and won't be clear *what to do*.

I'm a relativist who enjoys and applies these principles all the time, you have
to read my article on
[everything is relative](../../philosophy/everything-is-relative), I've been 
developing these days with more insights I have every day.
