## Leveraging the Law as the Ultimate Source

Taxation resources can be educational, professional advice, and the very law.

Educational ones can be the SAR course on income tax for the 2023 fiscal year[6]
I recently took, informative blogs like this article where I save references and
my experience, etc. They can also be webinars such as SAR webinars they give
throughout the year for free[7] and paid courses or webinars like the one I took
from EduSalud UNAH 3 months ago[8].

Advanced sources can come from the dedicated professional advice of licensed
accountants or lawyers with expertise in taxes in your country (or state), such
as SAR staff or contractors/employees working for an organization.

When studying tax matters, you must frequently go to the updated laws
corresponding to your inquiries since the law is the source of truth. Therefore,
as an entrepreneur, you have the responsibility to understand what the law says.
Then, you will also be able to process results from collaborators like
accountants.

Taking laws as the source of truth is like taking the source code and generating
the diagrams in SWE (not the other way around) or taking postulates in physics
or math to infer specific cases.

There are many educational resources for learning about income taxes in
Honduras, and the most advanced ones will include dedicated professional advice
grounded in the very laws. Whether you're a professional or run a business, you
must keep up to date with underlying laws since you will always have part of the
liability in your operations.

## Income Tax in Honduras

Legal documents such as the income tax law or "Ley de Impuesto Sobre la Renta"
in Spanish and the tax code provide the source to address the income tax in
Honduras.

Honduras' tax system is territorial, as stated by the tax code, article 1 Item 2
[1].

If you need to learn about income tax, you should read the income tax law [2]
and the tax code [1] that state the legal facts to apply to your inquiries or
necessities.

Always ensure to access updated versions of these legal documents. Old versions
might be intricate to read, but the one I left in the references is easy to
follow and "consolidated," so you don't have to read the original text and the
updates separately.

Recall that legal documents, such as the income law, are written in Spanish, so
you should use this language while applying technicalities to avoid
mistranslations or misinterpretations.

The income tax law gives many articles, yet you may find the most popular ones
more useful, mostly in the beginning.

### The First Article

The first article establishes the annual income tax and defines the essentials,
such as what "income" means. It taxes the incomes from work, capital, or both
determined by the body of this law.

It states that this tax is ruled by the payment capacity. So, you'll see later
how the rich will pay more taxes while the poor or elderly will be charged
progressively with exemption benefits.

The first article on the income tax in Honduras is obviously one of the
essentials you must read when you start learning about income tax. It gives you
the base definitions that will expand later within the rest of the law body.

### Deductions

When you declare your income tax, you should include all your valid deductions
or expenses in its computation to minimize the tax to pay at last, as the law
gives you these credits.

It's crucial to understand what a *valid deduction* is, because you may not add
anything you want but only the expenses the law allows you to consider.

If you don't include deductions (even minimal ones) in your tax declarations,
you will pay more taxes than fair, and the government will accept these
shamelessly and happily. Conversely, if you make up deductions and pay fewer
taxes than fair, you'll get into trouble; hence, it is crucial to keep
documentation to protect you.

Therefore, you're responsible for deducting all your expenses carefully and
following the law with proper documentation to save that extra money you
shouldn't pay in taxes while ensuring you pay the correct amount.

If you pay more taxes than mandatory, they will receive it happily, but if you
pay less because you add altered deductions or random expenses, you'll probably
get into trouble.

Finally, if you have proper documentation, play fair, and are well-informed by
following what the law gives you, then you should be all right while minimizing
your taxes to pay.

### Deduction Criteria

You must follow some articles from the law to determine the expenses to deduct
when filing your income tax and get this right the law gives you.

The underlying articles correspond to the #11, #12 and #13. So, you read the
income law to get the details about these criteria.

Article #11 introduces and addresses the deductibles for businesses, article #12
gives non-deductible expenses, and article #13 gives acceptable deductibles for
natural persons.
