## Leveraging the Law as the Ultimate Source

Taxation resources can be educational, professional advice, and the very law.

Educational ones can be the SAR course on income tax for the 2023 fiscal year[6]
I recently took, informative blogs like this article where I save references and
my experience, etc. They can also be webinars such as SAR webinars they give
throughout the year for free[7] and paid courses or webinars like the one I took
from EduSalud UNAH 3 months ago[8].

Advanced sources can come from the dedicated professional advice of licensed
accountants or lawyers with expertise in taxes in your country (or state), such
as SAR staff or contractors/employees working for an organization.

When studying tax matters, you must frequently go to the updated laws
corresponding to your inquiries since the law is the source of truth. Therefore,
as an entrepreneur, you have the responsibility to understand what the law says.
Then, you will also be able to process results from collaborators like
accountants.

Taking laws as the source of truth is like taking the source code and generating
the diagrams in SWE (not the other way around) or taking postulates in physics
or math to infer specific cases.

There are many educational resources for learning about income taxes in
Honduras, and the most advanced ones will include dedicated professional advice
grounded in the very laws. Whether you're a professional or run a business, you
must keep up to date with underlying laws since you will always have part of the
liability in your operations.

## Income Tax in Honduras

Legal documents such as the income tax law or "Ley de Impuesto Sobre la Renta"
in Spanish and the tax code provide the source to address the income tax in
Honduras.

Honduras' tax system is territorial, as stated by the tax code, article 1 Item 2
[1].

If you need to learn about income tax, you should read the income tax law [2]
and the tax code [1] that state the legal facts to apply to your inquiries or
necessities.

Always ensure to access updated versions of these legal documents. Old versions
might be intricate to read, but the one I left in the references is easy to
follow and "consolidated," so you don't have to read the original text and the
updates separately.

Recall that legal documents, such as the income law, are written in Spanish, so
you should use this language while applying technicalities to avoid
mistranslations or misinterpretations.

The income tax law gives many articles, yet you may find the most popular ones
more useful, mostly in the beginning.

### The First Article

The first article establishes the annual income tax and defines the essentials,
such as what "income" means. It taxes the incomes from work, capital, or both
determined by the body of this law.

It states that this tax is ruled by the payment capacity. So, you'll see later
how the rich will pay more taxes while the poor or elderly will be charged
progressively with exemption benefits.

The first article on the income tax in Honduras is obviously one of the
essentials you must read when you start learning about income tax. It gives you
the base definitions that will expand later within the rest of the law body.

### Deductions

When you declare your income tax, you should include all your valid deductions
or expenses in its computation to minimize the tax to pay at last, as the law
gives you these rights.

It's crucial to understand what a *valid deduction* is, because you may not add
anything you want but only the expenses the law allows you to consider.

If you don't include deductions (even minimal ones) in your tax declarations,
you will pay more taxes than fair, and the government will accept these
shamelessly and happily. Conversely, if you make up deductions and pay fewer
taxes than fair, you'll get into trouble; hence, it is crucial to keep
documentation to protect you.

Therefore, you're responsible for deducting all your expenses carefully and
following the law with proper documentation to save that extra money you
shouldn't pay in taxes while ensuring you pay the correct amount.

If you pay more taxes than mandatory, they will receive it happily, but if you
pay less because you add altered deductions or random expenses, you'll probably
get into trouble.

Finally, if you have proper documentation, play fair, and are well-informed by
following what the law gives you, then you should be all right while minimizing
your taxes to pay.

### Deduction Criteria

You must follow some articles from the law to determine the expenses to deduct
when filing your income tax and get this right the law gives you.

The underlying articles correspond to the #11, #12 and #13 [4]. So, you read the
income law to get the details about these criteria.

Article #11 introduces and addresses the deductibles for businesses, article #12
gives non-deductible expenses, and article #13 gives acceptable deductibles for
natural persons.

#### Deduction for Businesses and Generalities

First, you must understand an essential basis for identifying a deductible
expense. As per article #11, the **net taxable income (renta neta gravable)** is
the **gross income (renta bruta)** minus deductions. Where deductions must (be):

- Ordinary and necessary expenses to generate the income.
- Belong to the underlying period or year.
- Properly demonstrated/documented.
- Already paid.

Moreover, article #11 enumerates instances of these deductions in its items a-n.

Your deductions to determine your net taxable income must be **necessary to
generate your income**, for example, office expenses since you can't provide
your professional services without a computer or internet connection.

You must be careful when taking an expense as necessary when it actually isn't.
Personal expenses are invalid since they must be directly related to those that
generate your income.

There are subtle cases, too. For example, someone who charges for beauty
services but pays their college fees as an accountant. Then, the accountant's
license or fees are invalid expenses since the person generates the income with
beauty services and not as an accountant.

Further, the law (article #13) will give natural persons a fixed amount for
health and educational expenses, so you may not report your medical bills as
deductibles since these are a fixed part they granted to you already.

Your deductions must belong to **the fiscal year you're filling them**. For
example, you fill in the income tax for 2023, and it's April 2024. Then, your
deductions go for expenses from 2023 (Jan 1 to Dec 31) unless you work with a
different period (e.g., agriculture).

You must **duly verify** your deductions with proper documentation. You need to
get your expenses billed with **CAI (Clave de Autorización de Impresión)**[10],
which local companies implement in their billings, and on behalf of your **RTN
(Registro Tributario Nacional)**[11], which is your identity number as a
taxpayer.

If you have expenses from non-local business, you'll have to figure out how to
document it properly.

For special cases, I asked in a webinar[8] about public services, such as water
and electricity billings, since these don't add your RTN number to the billing.
These services are considered special expenses, where you document the billing
with your payment transaction, then SAR or the "fisco" or government won't
reject the expense.

Finally, article #11 says that you must have **already paid the expenses**, so
you may only register the deductibles you paid in the underlying period, not
expenses you will pay (or paid already) in another fiscal period.

The examples are many, and you must read the law articles to get a complete
insight into what these expenses encompass.

Article #11 of the income law provides the essential insight for deducing
expenses that apply to businesses but also anyone else. You define the taxable
income by subtracting the expenses from your gross income. When defining what
expenses the law accepts, you must follow four pillar criteria to ensure the
deductibles are necessary to generate the income, belong to the underlying
period, are properly documented, and are completely paid in such a period.

#### Unacceptable Deductions

Article #12 states some deduction instances you may not use when filling your
declaration.

It includes maintenance expenses for natural damage to assets that are already
part of depreciation deductions. Also, investments, personal expenses (with
exceptions given by article #13), gifts, capital losses, etc. The items a-f
expand on these rules for complete information.

Article #12 enumerates the items a-f, stating what you may not deduct from your
income tax. While together with article #11, you get a greater image of how
deductions work, there's still article #13 to complement deductions regarding
natural persons.

#### Deductions for Natural Persons

Article #13 states acceptable deductions for natural persons.

It gives you a fixed amount for educational and medical expenses. It currently
consists of up to L.40,000.00 (~ USD 1,616). You don't need to have any
documentation for these expenses. You always have that amount granted without
justification or documentation, which is an exception to the rule seen in
Article #11 above. If your medical expenses exceed that amount, you won't be
able to deduce the extra.

The above is complemented by setting a greater amount of up to L.80,000.00 for
persons older than 65.

You may deduct expenses as a professional as long as they're properly
documented (recall what was said in Article #11).

Other deductibles include particulars about farmers and certain donations.
Donations may not exceed 10% of the net taxable income.

Article #13 closes up the statements about deductions with those accepted for
natural persons. Personal deductions such as medical and educational ones are an
exception, not requiring documentation, and have a bound limit. We also have
professional expenses if you provide professional services with proper
documentation.
