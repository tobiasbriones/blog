# Product Importation Logistics in HN (2023/11/03)

## Importing Products and Running Businesses in HN

There's a chance you can operate traditional businesses in Honduras (HN). Since
I've lived here for over 15 years straight until I finished university, I
can leverage that experience to develop something in these bounds.

First, you have to **expect the severe challenges** you find in countries like
these: corruption, transparency issues, violence, poverty, economic instability,
slow adoption of technology (i.e., over half the population use the internet),
inequality at significant levels, slow regulatory and legislative approvals,
tied to the economic performance of the US, large informal economy competes for
market share, extreme weather events (reconstruction of 2020 hurricanes are
still in progress) [1][2], etc.

Expanding, the events that occurred during the last years, besides weather
events, like the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 2021 elections changing
administration after 12 years of[^1] same-party government had led to a negative
impact on imports due to political, economic, legal, and social changes and
events [5].

[^1]: Dictatorship by conservatives/nationalists (a.k.a. the nationalist party),
    8 of the 12 years with illegal dictatorship as far as we can tell

High tax rates and no duty or tax de minimis [^2] is another challenge for
landed costs [1], but let's not consider it a challenge of the country itself
like the ones listed above since taxes won't inherently limit you.

[^2]: Tax de minimis is a threshold (equals to zero in HN ðŸ’€) where "duty and
    tax are only charged on imports where the CIF value of the import exceeds
    the de minimis"[1]

Since the tax de minimis is zero, **all imports are charged duty and tax fees**.

Another well-known fact here that's not explicitly listed in my references is
that you can't open any business at all in ordinary places because you get
extorted by gangsters *unless you pick a strategic place in a mall or high-end
area or e-commerce*, so you don't risk your life for trying to do your job
either if you're a worker or entrepreneur.

Extortion increased 153% in 2022 compared to 2021 concentrating the denunciation
in the Central District (capital) and San Pedro Sula, that is, the major cities.
Of these, 95% are from the urban area. Moreover, 62% average of homes in the
Central District and San Pedro Sula are in poverty conditions [9].

On the other hand, there are benefits and improvements in the situation.

There are trade agreements[^3] (at least 10[1]) and negotiations like the
**WTO (World Trade Organization)** Honduras has been a member of since 1995 [5].

[^3]: These agreements allow to get benefits like low duty range often
    waived [1]

Infrastructure and modernization are being prioritized, there's accessibility to
shipping to Honduras and universal payment methods. Honduras could soon become
the gateway to Central America, it values quality imports, and it has the
second-highest economic growth rate in Central America [2].

Out of serious challenges and benefits/improvements, what struck me as relevant
is the fact that **"over half the population use the internet, less than half
shop online, making the market opportunity average."** This, together with the
informal economy, severely affects the e-commerce market, which leads us to
focus on market research to validate niche, active products, and consumers.

General-purpose businesses are saturated here in SPS if that helps.

The informal economy is growing hugely due to unemployment and labor
opportunities, while mipymes generate more than 70% of jobs that still prefer
the informal way. Formal jobs are disappearing due to low importance to national
production. There have been more than 10,000 businesses that have been closed or
gone informal [8].

Some students pay stuff from nano businesses they run, so any money you can put
to work is good to relativize your money. It's like exercising: putting money to
work produces more money, but saving it won't.

Despite the unfavorable conditions of running businesses in Honduras, if you're
a citizen, have expertise in the territory, and some money to put to work
(even a small amount), you can devise some strategy to overcome the difficulties
and set up a side business that helps you out in these tough times. Regarding
bringing products in, the situation allows it, and it's improving in
modernization.
