## Inception: The Imaginary Computer and the Cyber Era

I was drawn to computers while I grew up, and my fascination with tech
persisted, leading me to learn through observation. Despite limited resources, I
honed abstract tech skills. These experiences forged my innate tech aptitude,
marking just the start of my tech journey.

When I was a kid (about six years old), I stared at the desktop computers at the
supermarket. They were used to print price tickets, for example. They were old
2000s square PCs, as that was the available tech back then.

So, one day, I even made up a simple and boring cardboard computer to fill the
desire to have one.

I always grew up staring at computers because I never had one, and "I was born
with tech in my traits."

**I've always observed**. That's how I figured out how to use the mouse wheel
and find "information in Google" in the mere beginnings of the 2010s when I
found ways to go to the "cybercaf√©" to play GTA VC and view Nokia phones[^x].

[^x]: I was always obsessed with Nokia models like N97, N8, 5800, X6, and many
    other good OL' legends since I never had the chance to get any; I lived
    extremely excited to know everything about them and hoped to have one
    someday

Sure, I was so naive that I had to figure out sooner rather than later that I
had to click the Google search results to go to the website instead of staying
with the result snippet only, that I could use the mouse wheel to scroll instead
of dragging the scroll bar, and that the GTA Vice City introduction wasn't
mandatory and could be skipped.

One day, I sat down and imagined in my mind how I played FIFA on the old
square house TV when turned off. **I was developing abstract skills out of
need: I couldn't have a decent computer or any at all**.

They were learning and gaming times[^x][^x]. I started from nothing at a fast
learning rate, given the extreme limitations.

[^x]: Until today, I've never had a GPU or gaming PC (the closest I've had has
    barely been my current LG G8X, i.e., a 2019 high-end I acquired in late
    2021)

[^x]: I've always been committed to PC and mobile gaming, disregarding any lag,
    and I used to play many good OL' low-spec games in the 2010s out of passion,
    similar to **how I used to read computer and smartphone reviews on the web
    all the time**

Hard times and innate tech skills are what was about in the beginning, but hard
times are just the beginning of the beginning.

## Extreme Decade Challenges

### My Very First Computer

The first computer I had was a gift (because it didn't turn on), but 
I could find the pattern to make it work and give it a try for a 
long while.

The computer was a Dell Optiplex GX270 from 2003 that they gave me near 2011 (if
memory serves me right). The "gift" was due to the machine's state ‚Äî*it didn't
turn on and was basically trash* ü§Ø.

It had a trick to turn it on, and as expected ‚Äî*I'm well known for finding 
mysterious patterns*.

It was a Pentium 4 HT with 512MB DDR of RAM Windows XP and 40GB of HHD disk in
~2011, and it didn't even turn on well üí•.

In a few moments, I was able to find the trick (as far as I remember): I just
had to plug the power cord, and when the LED turns on, quickly unplug it and
plug it back again ‚úî.

I used first, mobile data[^x] (from my LG Optimus ME I had for a long time, and
after having my Moto Q[^x]) via USB to share the connection, then a residential
`512Kbps` was acquired[^x] to "do homeworks" you know[^x].

[^x]: Fun Fact üêØ: In the beginning (in 2009), I used phone balance
    (with some 3x or 4x balance bonus, I used to buy 1GB packs in the end to
    have one day üëæ) to enter the internet in a Samsung phone (not smart) I
    bought at about $30 (then was cheapened to about $10 after I paid for it
    üòí), and I dreamed to be able to play web videos on that tiny
    $$96x96 pixels^?$$ brick (something impossible obviously)

[^x]: The Moto Q is one main pillar of my story as it was a failed device, and
    its internet connection never worked, but even so, I hacked into it to get
    internet (GPRS/EDGE) for free

[^x]: For buggy reasons due to the old contract, I guess; I got to have 10Mbps
    speed for months after some years in about 2017, then 512Kbps, then 20Mbps
    other time, then slow again

[^x]: I leveraged everything I could to learn; I've always been self-taught

I haven't mentioned **I never had a monitor until 2019, when I was first able to
buy my HP 22cwa (22" FHD)**.

I used a ~~scholarship~~ service job scholarship[^x] money I got in late 2018
to buy my first monitor and desk to work on.

[^x]: I was persuaded to engage in this university program since I wasn't even
    applicable due to my two simultaneous majors, and it's only about
    bureaucracy and service work, totally unemphatic to super tough careers like
    mathematics due to other issues like incompatible requirements they ask

So, until 2019, I had to use the house TV as a huge 32" monitor, but 720p
resolution üòµ. Besides having *extremely low pixel density*, it was getting
older, too.

If that wasn't enough, I had that TV available because it was a supermarket
raffle we won in 2009 by mere chance of life. I don't know what could've
happened if it wasn't for that touch of luck long ago.

Therefore, with all this context, I could endure at the beginning of this tech
era.

My first computer, a Dell Optiplex GX270 from 2003, was a "gift" in ~2011,
albeit not in working condition, but I managed to decipher the pattern to bring
it to life. I didn't even have a monitor until 2019. Until then, I relied on the
32" 720p house TV, and the internet connection was what I could barely afford.

### The First Computer I Bought

Approximately around 2013, I could actually buy a computer: The Dell Optiplex
745, another terrible computer.

I had some savings of about $90 and could afford to buy a refurbished 745 back
then. It was a bad decision: for a few bucks, I could get a Core2Duo version.
Never mind.

The computer was gross: Pentium D 2.8Ghz, 1GB of RAM DDR2, 80GB of HDD
disk, and Windows XP or 7 if I wanted.

If that's not enough, I was also scammed: the HDD failed after a few months
(I had to reinstall Windows 7 every day ü§™ and buy a new disk).

Okay, so I used this computer for a few years more, but the experience was
horrible, like the previous one.

That Pentium D is most likely **the worst dual-core Intel processor**. It got
overly hot, and the fan made so much noise that you could hear it from the house
entrance[^x].

[^x]: When I started using the CPU by opening software, the fan went all the
    way up; remember that ambient temperatures were (still are) about 36 ¬∞C most
    of the time

I was learning programming, and one day, I opened up Android Studio (recall, 1
GB of RAM). Say no more. I had to unplug the cord from the power outlet to
unfreeze the computer in its misery üí•. Seriously, Android Studio in 1 GB of
memory? üòÜ.

I used Eclipse with the Android SDK for many years for Java and Android, from
about 2013 to 2017.

Not to say video games, I played what I could.

Now, something wrong happened in 2016. I was cleaning the PC, but when I closed
the CPU socket, it made a funny noise ü§™. I just had screwed up the CPU socket
pins, and now I had to get a new motherboard.

All Optiplex PCs I've had have been small form factor, by the way.

Unfortunately, I didn't find any spare parts, so I had to settle with a Mini
Tower motherboard I found on eBay.

After receiving the motherboard, I set up everything again, but a mad truth I
knew was coming: it didn't fit in the SFF case üòÇ:

</figcaption>

The solution was to **assemble it barebones** and try to be careful with that
environment.

Even so, nothing stopped me from keeping growing and learning. No matter how
much lag, lack of resources, or unfavorable life limitations.

I was in my first year of university by then, but there were many terms lost due
to nonsense political strikes.

Most of what I've learned (and played) has been through these miserably low-end
refurbished equipment. I made and flashed Android ROMs in ~2012, started
learning Java concepts and Android development, graduated from my electronics
high school career in 2014 (e.g., I was the only one who could program),
already did web development in 2015[1], learned English almost from scratch in
2015, and got to study two majors at the university with top global grades, etc.

In other words, these pictures represent a genius's successful struggles.
Engineers solve problems, and mathematicians optimize. That's what I do.

**I appreciate the goodwill efforts I've made as a form of original art**.
It's a lovely motivation where I make the good of the past persist[^x].

[^x]: Persisting your genuine achievements is a key to be **relative and
    scale**, e.g., you keep using today what you achieved 15 years ago

So it was incredibly challenging to have learned so much and moved on with
machines and third-world living conditions like these.

That Optiplex 745 was the first computer I bought, which made me pass through
many weird challenges.

#### My Mobile Phone during the University

The Hyundai UNO L505 was the low-end phone that was with me for over 6 years
during the university, and I used it to learn much of what I know today.

I bought it for about $110 in early 2016 when it had a "discount" (it was
cheapened about $30 a few months after I bought it üòí). It was a low-end (the
best of the worst) that I could afford with all my current savings. It was a
good decision ‚úî. I was in a hurry to get a phone.

I wanted to buy it because **I always choose elegant designs**. Albeit the
Optiplex 745 PC *wasn't elegant at all but a Frankenstein*, I did what I could.

The model was elegant, had a "big" 5" screen, and was under the budget.

Its MediaTek quad-core processor and Mali-T720 MP2 sucked for gaming, so I had
to do what I could[^x].

[^x]: If you wonder why gaming's been important to me, it's because it allows me
    to engage with mental models, and it's also been the only escape I've had

**I used this phone to study when my computer was broken or when I was at the
university**.

With low-end and even broken devices like all these, I learned much like
programming, electronics, English, physics I and II, math from calculus to
topology, abstract algebra, etc. I also held top grades, if that wasn't enough.

Since I make decisions with rationale, I always wanted to keep working with
desktop refurbished computers because of their power and low prices, even when
they're old junk; it's pretty strategic as it was impossible to get anything
better as a student.

Power is everything when being an engineer. Laptops were always a complete joke
for me, and developing engineering skills as a self-taught was always a 
priority. Hence, I chose desktops over laptops.

The problem with desktops is that I was screwed up when I needed a "computer"
(they mean a laptop) for a in-campus exam or work (online classes didn't exist
until 2020).

The trade-off is crucial: a powerful laptop (which is nonsense) costs you many
times more than an older and powerful Optiplex desktop. Not to say the
maintenance costs of toy laptops.

So, **I used my phone to read PDF books and copy math problems to solve while on
the university campus**.

The screen got broken in the end because I thought I dropped it into my pocket,
but it fell out to the corner of the concrete üò£. It still worked and used it for
about 2 years more.

Then, I understood that **any computer or device is useful for learning if you
have the discipline to supersede your limits. The real problem is when you have
to professionally work: you need a powerful workstation to work as a
professional engineer**.

I'm currently working in my office and automating design decisions, but it's
never been easy: you need a pricey engineering office to work and get money, but
you also need money to get decent equipment to work with. If you know me, you
understand that **I use relativity to get out of these *cycles***.

That's how my phone was a necessary element I leveraged during these developing
times and allowed me to study and do much out of it.

## My Opportunity: The Optiplex 790

### The First Time I Could Have a Powerful Computer

In 2017, I could afford to buy a relatively powerful computer with less than
$200 I saved during two months of university strikes.

There were more strikes at the university in 2017, and they canceled a term that
was reset after all.

I was currently taking[^x] "Differential Equations," "Data Structures," "Complex
Variable," "Physics I," "Calculus III," and "Introduction to Systems
Engineering." **Six classes for a single term, an excessively challenging life
environment, and top grades were another seriously massive success**. No one
ordinary can keep up with that. *The physics professor (i.e., the department
boss and the hardest one to approve) even gave me money to go to the cinema as I
had the best exams out of all physics sections*[^x].

[^x]: It was the II term in 2017 that was expanded to the rest of the year
    (consuming the III term that was lost) due to more strikes

[^x]: It's popular that most engineering students don't pass these classes the
    first time, so giving some "prize" was a "motivational experiment," but
    these always failed

Back then, I had thought to buy something about $130 I could afford, but the
options were gross as well: I could only have old garbage like Core2Duo
computers at best.

I saved money for two months of strikes while I was studying at home with my
phone and the Frankenstein. Then, **it was super exciting when I checked the
announcement on the internet with I5 processor computers under the budget!**

I was really happy when I found that I didn't have to buy another horrible
computer from 2008 or older, like a Core2Duo. It was the first time I came
across "powerful" quad-core PCs at that price.

This time was a special milestone for me since **it was the first time I was
going to have a computer so powerful**: The Dell Optiplex 790 (SFF, year 2011)
with I5 2400 3. 1Ghz, 4GB of RAM DDR3 and 250GB HHD.

I'd never had and had felt how it is to have a quad-core I5 processor, 4GB of
RAM, and a computer that didn't look like Frankenstein. For most people, that's
something ordinary, but for me, it was a dream.

Therefore, I went to the store ("Tecknos Design") and acquired my computer.

I got the computer delivered to my house an afternoon at 5 pm, and it was great.
I'd never had computers like these before. Fortunately, that day was finally
realized.

<p align="center"><strong>

</figcaption>

I removed the wrap[^x], started using the "new" (refurbished) computer, and
started noticing the huge differences compared to older machines[^x].

[^x]: Fun Fact üêØ: In events like these, I take pictures, so this time, I can
    write it down, for example

[^x]: After six years, I'm writing this article about the day I first
    got a decent computer üëæ, i.e., **I feel the semantics of what happens to
    me**

As I said, I still didn't have a monitor, so continued using the TV until 2019.

By achieving this Optiplex 790, a lot of future terrain to conquer was waiting,
and here we are now, building that mathematical and software engineering future I had longed for so much.
