## Inception: The Imaginary Computer and the Cyber Era

I was drawn to computers while I grew up, and my fascination with tech
persisted, leading me to learn through observation. Despite limited resources, I
honed abstract tech skills. These experiences forged my innate tech aptitude,
marking just the start of my tech journey.

When I was a kid (about six years old), I stared at the desktop computers at the
supermarket. They were used to print price tickets, for example. They were old
2000s square PCs, as that was the available tech back then.

So, one day, I even made up a simple and boring cardboard computer to fill the
desire to have one.

I always grew up staring at computers because I never had one, and "I was born
with tech in my traits."

**I've always observed**. That's how I figured out how to use the mouse wheel
and find "information in Google" in the mere beginnings of the 2010s when I
found ways to go to the "cybercaf√©" to play GTA VC and view Nokia phones[^x].

[^x]: I was always obsessed with Nokia models like N97, N8, 5800, X6, and many
    other good OL' legends since I never had the chance to get any; I lived
    extremely excited to know everything about them and hoped to have one
    someday

Sure, I was so naive that I had to figure out sooner rather than later that I
had to click the Google search results to go to the website instead of staying
with the result snippet only, that I could use the mouse wheel to scroll instead
of dragging the scroll bar, and that the GTA Vice City introduction wasn't
mandatory and could be skipped.

One day, I sat down and imagined in my mind how I played FIFA on the old
square house TV when turned off. I was developing abstract skills out of
need: I couldn't have a decent computer or any at all.

They were learning and gaming times[^x][^x]. I started from nothing at a fast
learning rate, given the extreme limitations.

[^x]: Until today, I've never had a GPU or gaming PC (the closest I've had has
    barely been my current LG G8X, i.e., a 2019 high-end I acquired in late
    2021)

[^x]: I've always been committed to PC and mobile gaming, disregarding any lag,
    and I used to play many good OL' low-spec games in the 2010s out of passion,
    similar to **how I used to read computer and smartphone reviews on the web
    all the time**

Hard times and innate tech skills are what was about in the beginning, but hard
times are just the beginning of the beginning.
