## Vocational Fair

The vocational fair is usually performed once a year, where the community, like
university stakeholders (students, academics, etc.), and other guests like
high-school[^1] students, assist in exploring or presenting projects related to
career offers.

[^1]: High-school students are those who will soon reach higher education, like
    college or university

> The Vocational Fair has as its main purpose the orientation, advice, and
> socialization of the educational offer, as well as the academic services that
> the most important university in the country offers to aspiring graduates of
> secondary education, with the objective that future university students assume
> a successful choice of their career, taking into account their interests,
> aptitudes and vocational preferences.

Careers have the chance to show what potential new students can achieve or
engage in regarding professional paths.

## My Challenge

I set up a challenge for me alone to devise about 12 projects to show that day.
In the end, I was able to undertake about half of them, and it was a total
success.

All my projects (as usual) were completely original, and I could exploit many
concepts behind them that motivated me to do all this.

Time and money were scarce, so I worked on what I could. At that moment, I was
enrolled in Mathematical Programming I, Electrical Circuits[^2] for Systems
Engineering, Administration I[^3], and Partial Differential Equations. I was
also enrolled in Geometry I[^4][^5] but canceled it.

[^2]: I presented one of my projects to this course's final project. The
    professor was one of the worst I had. He rarely appeared, had major issues
    with the class, and told me the project he wanted was something super
    simple, but I presented something way greater than his expectations ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è,
    so he doesn't even like great student jobs but fool ones

[^3]: This course from systems engineering referred to business admin

[^4]: The class was taught by an archaic professor who preferred teaching
    Euclidean geometry instead of the originally designated differential
    geometry. His mentality was always based on the idiotic assumption that
    studying math meant pursuing a teaching career because Euclidean is the
    geometry taught here to first-year students, so you have to learn it.
    Moreover, I hated Euclidean geometry, as it resembles more of a civil
    engineering drawing class that heavily relies on visuals to construct
    "proofs." On the other hand, I'm into calculus or differential geometry,
    which offer a more abstract and conceptually pure approach to math

[^5]: This is like using Photoshop with the mouse to draw shapes, while I can
    get it with a Canvas DSL using actual source code. Another take, as an
    amateur pilot simulation player, is that I avoid "the visuals" in the pro
    of the actual aircraft instruments. That is, I always choose abstractions
    (the fear of many)

I was also attending an "English for Call Center" training at Altia Business
Park, which lasted about 5 weeks, with 3 hours per day. It was an engaging
activity where I learned about the call center industry and a few English
insights [^6].

[^6]: Additionally, I used to enjoy food at the mall. Despite not having
    substantial savings, I never viewed money as a significant factor in
    happiness. Even to this day, I possess the ability to find contentment
    without requiring a large amount of money.

Furthermore, I participated in events at UNITEC located near the business and
(Altara) mall area. Engaging in those activities during those months made me
feel like an entrepreneur. Now, I have become one.

I was also engaging into the new chapters of Dragon Ball Heroes that were
appearing in that time üòÜ.

I worked with some projects or ideas I had already developed like **Losnot
in Paradise**[7] ‚Äîgame with AI in Java I developed the previous year for the
"Programming II" course from the mathematics career.

I developed new great ideas like **PicRT Express**[7] ‚ÄîUWP app that implements
a bridge to call C++ from C# to use OpenCV for image processing on the
high-level client app.

I also developed **hardware** challenges like an **LED-based Pac-Man** 
consisting of LEDs I arranged so it looks like a Pac-Man and one potentiometer
to control with a 555 IC the speed at which they blink.

Regarding failed experiments, I've failed to build an **FM Transmitter** since
high-school. Issues like capacitance levels appear when working on protoboards,
so I used to choose the PCB[^8] instead, but it never worked. Telecom is 
not an easy field [^9].

[^8]: I learned basis to design PCBs and electronic circuits at high-school
    where I studied (industrial) electronics

[^9]: Take into account that it might be illegal, even for educational
    purposes, to run these transmitters if their signal gets too far away or
    collides with legal frequencies or channels, which adds another layer of
    complexity to telecommunications engineering

Designing the circuits, ideas, and PCBs was a bit more though as working with
hardware is different from software.

So, for the hardware projects, I had to spend some money, and go out get them,
which added another significant layer of complexity for me.

Another trouble I had was taking my personal desktop computer[^10][^11] and 
monitor[^12] to the university since I was personally looking forward to 
engaging *without expecting any reward* due to personal motivation, and that 
was the only option I had [^13].

[^10]: I've only had a desktop computer because I invested my savings in this PC
    since I was always pretty clever and knew a desktop PC is more powerful and
    cheaper than a laptop (what everyone has), and I was right. Now I've
    gotten internships or jobs at startups, I'm founding mathsoftware.engineer
    and MathSwe and still use this PC, on the other hand, I can buy a better
    workstation, but I haven't done it because I'm careful with relevant design
    decisions with heavy investment

[^11]: Fun Fact üêØ: I'm still using the Optiplex 790 for writing this article

[^12]: The HP monitor got partially damaged about one and a half years ago,
    and I still use it as a second monitor, so same as the PC, I don't get 3 5K
    27" monitors because these decisions are not easy at all, even after growing
    a lot over the years: *the good decisions I take always make me successful*

[^13]: Unfortunately, it's really hard to get support in a third-world country
    where people only want their egocentric affairs like getting their homework
    done for free, merely getting an approving grade on a course, mere service
    work credits with no added value, or getting rid of students like a
    bureaucracy-heavy school factory, but despite the difficulties, I always
    kept taking better decisions which were completely worth it: I'm here
    telling the story

I developed PicRT Express in just 5 days, and I'd never worked with UWP before
(and never will again üòÇ[^14]), so it was easier for me than working with
hardware.

[^14]: I really was a fan of UWP, and I loved it, but now it's a completely 
    different story, as the project was just another Micro$oft charade

It was an undertaking where I took care of everything because I love harder
challenges that make me grow.

I made the presentations and diagrams printed on the bottom facade to explain
the systems. I still have them on my open-source projects like Gencesk 2D[^15]
and PicRT Express.

[^15]: Gencesk 2D was a prototype game framework I used to build Losnot in
    Paradise. I learned to build game logic when I was tackling Android dev and 
    Canvas in ~2014. I invented the name "Gencesk" out of "JDesk"

I also had several software projects deployed into my computer to show, like
source code and ambient music for the pulsing LED board that blinks in sync
with the music.

That was a brief story of my challenges back in the day, and *I will certainly
keep working on important projects as promised to someone special* [^16].

[^16]: I always meet persons who strongly believe in me
