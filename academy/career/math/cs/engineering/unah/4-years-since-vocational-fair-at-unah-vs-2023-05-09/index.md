## Vocational Fair

The vocational fair is usually performed once a year, where the community, like
university stakeholders (students, academics, etc.), and other guests like
high-school[^1] students.

[^1]: High-school students are those who are near to entering superior education
    like college or university

> The Vocational Fair has as its main purpose the orientation, advice, and
> socialization of the educational offer, as well as the academic services that
> the most important university in the country offers to aspiring graduates of
> secondary education, with the objective that future university students assume
> a successful choice of their career, taking into account their interests,
> aptitudes and vocational preferences.

Careers have the chance to show what potential new students can achieve or
engage regarding professional paths.
