# Cookie Consent v0.1.0 | MathSwe Legal (2024/03/29)

## New Cookie Consent Microservice

The new Cookie Consent service was delivered as per the
[New Cookie Consent Microservice Ready | MathSwe Legal (2024/03/28)](/new-cookie-consent-microservice-ready---mathswe-legal-2024-03-28)
development, reaching its `v0.1.0` release.

## Requesting a Consent

Allowed MathSwe website and web apps can now send cookie consent requests for
their process at the production endpoint to complete the work of the cookie
banner or preference pane.

When users set or update cookie preferences, the client has to send
the `CookieConsentPref` JSON body to the service to finish validating the
request.

| Path | Method | Body                | Response        |
|------|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `/`  | `POST` | `CookieConsentPref` | `CookieConsent` |

`Cookie Consent Request Body`

```rust
pub struct CookieConsentPref {
    essential: bool,
    functional: bool,
    analytics: bool,
    targeting: bool,
}
```

Notice that `essential` is, in theory, always `true` and does not require
consent. The other values go according to the preferences the user chooses.

When processed correctly, the server will respond with a `CookieConsent` JSON
value.

`Cookie Consent Response`

```rust
pub struct CookieConsent {
    id: String,
    value: CookieConsentValue,
}

pub struct CookieConsentValue {
    domain: Domain,
    pref: CookieConsentPref,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    geolocation: Geolocation,
    anonymous_ip: Option<AnonymousIpv4>,
    user_agent: String,
}
```

The `id` field is a unique `String` value that identifies a cookie consent
record.

The other specific values correspond to:

`Specific Response Values`

```rust
pub enum Domain {
    MathSweCom,
    MathSoftware,
    MathSoftwareEngineer,
}

pub struct Geolocation {
    time_zone: chrono_tz::Tz,
    colo: String,
    country: Option<String>,
    city: Option<String>,
    continent: Option<String>,
    coordinates: Option<(f32, f32)>,
    postal_code: Option<String>,
    metro_code: Option<String>,
    region: Option<String>,
    region_code: Option<String>,
}

pub struct AnonymousIpv4(String);
```

Regarding the `Geolocation` type, I've been reviewing it and found many
unnecessary details that I will remove for `v0.2.0`. That is because I modeled
all the geolocation data Cloudflare provides in an HTTP request in case "it's
needed," but it includes many nonsensical fields to remove, and many seem to
be `null` anyway. Therefore, the next release will apply data minimization to
this geolocation information.

Regarding the `AnonymousIpv4` type, it applies data minimization by converting
the user IP into the last-digit anonymous IP. The technique makes the last IP
octet zero to minimize storing the full IP address, for example, it
turns `xxx.yyy.zzz.www` to `xxx.yyy.zzz.0`.

**The client must store at least the essential parts of that response**,
probably in the cookies itself, to provide the user with the ID generated for
the effective consent and the updated cookie banner preferences.

**Essential response data is** the `id: String`, `pref: CookieConsentPref`,
and `created_at: DateTime<Utc>` fields. The ID is the key to claiming a
consent record. Recall that anyone who enters a website can give consent without
any login, so the consent ID identifies *who gave consent*.

The current production deployment is available at
`https://mathswe-cookie-consent.tobiasbriones-dev.workers.dev`, where it'll
receive allowed MathSwe client requests via the method `POST`.

The [Cookie Consent v0.1.0 documentation](https://github.com/mathswe/legal/tree/v0.1.0/cookie-consent#cookie-consent-1)
has further details to integrate it with a client.

The release and deployment of the Cookie Consent v0.1.0 service enable client
cookie banners to finish most of the remaining compliance requirements after
users consent to how the underlying website or web app may use their cookie
data.

## Complying with the GDPR

Complying with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** is often an
advanced requirement to allow business operations in some EU countries. The work
of the new Cookie Consent service helps with the advanced requirement of consent
demonstration.

### Consent Definition and Implementations

User consent is necessary to process their personal data. The client
applications must request consent transparently and allow users to update
consent preferences at any time.

The GDPR defines **consent** as follows:

> â€˜consentâ€™ of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and
> unambiguous indication of the data subjectâ€™s wishes by which he or she, by a
> statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the
> processing of personal data relating to him or her;
>
> Source: #11 \| Art. 4 GDPR â€“ Definitions [1]

Moreover, the GDPR is an upper boundary to take as a reference, as said by
GDPR.eu:

> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the toughest privacy and
> security law in the world. Though it was drafted and passed by the European
> Union (EU), it imposes obligations onto organizations anywhere, so long as
> they target or collect data related to people in the EU.
>
> Source: What is GDPR, the EUâ€™s new data protection law? \| GDPR.eu [4]

These definitions are general for legally processing personal data; they're not
limited to cookie usage. So, the process applied to the Cookie Consent
microservice and the cookie banner has *started building a framework for further
consent requirements in MathSwe*.

For example, if you want users to leave their email, which is personal data, you
can update them with a newsletter. So, in other cases besides cookies, I can
leverage the experience and standards of the cookie legal implementations
developed so far to comply more easily with more kinds of data protection
regulations in the future.

As always, MathSwe supports first-class open-source standards with thorough
transparency, and the current cookie legal implementations are one more proof of
that.

The GDPR definitions can be leveraged as raw legal facts to keep implementing
the most robust compliance in the future. Moreover, the existing progress with
the Cookie Consent service, the coming front-end details left to finish, and the
coming redaction of the cookie policy will act as a powerful framework to
maintain a robust legal basis in MathSwe.

### Proof of Consent

Advanced legal requirements in some EU countries encompass storing consent
records as proof demonstrating you're requesting proper users' consent.

> Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to
> demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her
> personal data.
>
> Source: #1 \| Art. 7 GDPR â€“ Conditions for consent [2]

The Cookie Consent service will receive requests from MathSwe websites and web
apps to process and store the famous **proof of consent** to demonstrate user
consent on cookie preferences.

Users can also update their consent at any time.

> The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any
> time.
>
> Source: #3 \| Art. 7 GDPR â€“ Conditions for consent [3]

The client app allows the user to set their preferences to update their
consent [^1], so it will emit a new consent through the microservice, and the
client app will overwrite the old consent.

[^1]: Via the footer's "Cookie Preference" button

Notice that the service gives a unique ID to each consent.

Consents can come from any user, like anonymous users without a personal
account. So, the consent ID defines *who gave it*. Therefore, you can claim the
consent record with the provided ID stored in the client app, so it is key[^2]
*to show this ID in the cookie banner* when consent is effective for that
client.

[^2]: Pun intended since the consent ID is *the key* to the consent value in the
    KV (Key Value) database

Demonstrating consent records requires complete information. It also requires
data minimization to avoid collecting more than needed. In that regard, you can
check [the `CookieConsent` response](#requesting-a-consent) to see how
accurately data is stored but minimized, like the `AnnonymousIpv4` that avoids
storing the full IP address while still serviceable. As said, the next release
effort will also apply data minimization to the `Geolocation` type.

One more challenge is to keep the reference of the information provided to the
user at that moment, that is, the cookie banner info and the cookie and privacy
policies. The Cookie Consent service doesn't store this boilerplate but can be
inferred thanks to the `mathswe/legal` repository, which will contain the policy
redactions versioned with Git.

The release celebrated in this article is a clear example of how MathSwe
open-source standards are rigorous and transparent. Tools can use information,
like repository tags, where microservices are versioned, to infer the privacy
and cookie policies at a given time. The process is then cohesive[^3]
and efficient[^4].

[^3]: The repository `legal` is only for legal microservices

[^4]: It's neither necessary nor wanted to store redundant data to comply;
    tracking the version of the privacy/cookie policies should work well, so the
    system is efficient without storing any massive boilerplate

Regarding "Storing consent records," Finsweet says, "Most websites do not have
this level of compliance. However, storing consent records is mandatory for some
countries under GDPR." [7]. Therefore, that's what I mention by
**advanced compliance**, and this is another point to celebrate in this release
ðŸŽ‰.

The Cookie Consent service does its best to store cookie consent records to
demonstrate user preferences with rich proofs that can determine any user
consent. Its functionality gets extended by other tools like the banner and more
advanced tools that MathSwe can create in the future to keep providing the
service with rigor.
