# MSW Ops v0.2.0 | MathSwe Ops MVP (2024/09/20)

## MSW Ops Home Page with the New Services Application

This release adds the MathSwe Ops Services project to a section on the landing
page and integrates it to improve its internal development documentation.

MathSwe Ops Services
[had its initial release](/mathswe-ops-services-v-0-1-0-2024-09-18) with two
endpoints providing badges for release and project (name with icon), and this
release presents it as a new project to final users.

MathSwe Ops Services documentation

GitHub release at
[Ops.Math.Software v0.2.0: Updates the MSW Ops Home Page with the New Services Application.](https://github.com/mathswe-ops/mathswe-ops---mvp/releases/tag/v0.2.0).

Presenting the Services project on the MSW Ops home page is a way to show how
MathSwe also supports General SWE (general-purpose), besides MSWE (mathematical
domain-specific).
