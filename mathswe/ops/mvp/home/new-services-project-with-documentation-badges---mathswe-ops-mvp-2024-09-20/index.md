# New Services Project with Documentation Badges | MathSwe Ops MVP (2024/09/20)

Old release and project badges requiring manual maintenance are no longer
necessary, thanks to the new MathSwe Ops Services API that provides them to
MathSwe projects. Being so, it should also feature space in the MSW Ops landing
page to show how MathSwe also supports general-purpose engineering.

**Update version and project badges with new MathSwe Ops Services badges**

Sep 20: PR [#18](https://github.com/mathswe-ops/mathswe-ops---mvp/pull/18) merged into `ops/dev <- ops/docs` by [tobiasbriones](https://github.com/tobiasbriones)
{: .pr-subtitle }

The old badges were manually maintained.

It implements the features delivered by [MathSwe Ops Services v0.1.0
(2024/09/18)](https://blog.mathsoftware.engineer/mathswe-ops-services-v-0-1-0-2024-09-18).

The new MathSwe API optimizes the version and project (name with icon) badges
for smoother release cycles while keeping quality documentation.

**Add section services to home page**

Sep 20: PR [#19](https://github.com/mathswe-ops/mathswe-ops---mvp/pull/19) merged into `ops/dev <- ops.math.software` by [tobiasbriones](https://github.com/tobiasbriones)
{: .pr-subtitle }

It adds the new MathSwe Ops Services project that just had its initial release.

---

The MathSwe Ops home page now includes the section for the Services API with its
initial features, consisting of two endpoints to get release and project badges.
Presenting the Services project is a way to show how MathSwe also supports
General SWE (general-purpose), besides MSWE (mathematical domain-specific).
