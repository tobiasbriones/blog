# Initializing the Texsydo GitHub Organization (2024/09/04)

## Texsydo Web and FX Prototypes

The two prototypes are Web, which I use to deploy my articles, and FX, which
automates cover images for Web. After validating and developing them as internal
prototypes, I am now upgrading them to MVPs hosted on the new Texsydo GitHub
organization. Their DSLs aim for the engineering grade, so this MVP space is
urgent to move them forward.

I've written about the technicalities in previous blogs.

- [Automating the Platform Operations and Beyond (2023/08/31)](/automating-the-platform-operations-and-beyond-2023-08-31).
- [Text Ops: New Add PR Command (2024/03/23)](/text-ops-_-new-add-pr-command-2024-03-23).
- [Testing the Texsydo FX Prototype (2024/09/03)](/testing-the-texsydo-fx-prototype-2024-09-03).

Texsydo Web is a tool that automates and standardizes the development of
mathematical articles or documentation with a web target. Texsydo FX compliments
the automation of standard graphical content like cover images and rendering of
mathematical models. They need their upgrade to MVP to formalize results as a
new MathSwe product providing Applied MSW essentials.
