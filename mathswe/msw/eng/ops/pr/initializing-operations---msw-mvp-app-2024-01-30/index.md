# Initializing Operations | Math Software MVP App (2024/01/30)

## Fast Paced Prototype

I started working on the app prototype in a single `index.html` file with the
styles I unofficially developed for MSW Engineer. I added upcoming styles and
some JS logic for the fractal animation with its special canvas parallax effect.

I (unofficially) deployed the prototypes to production and have been setting
priorities for the overwhelming projects, updates, and research I've had lately.

I'm urged to go to production since, as the founder, I need a return on my
investment after so much slack time in the past due to many other situations
that arise while growing as a professional. Thus, that's what I mean about
fixing priorities at this moment to trade minor tasks and projects behind for
the most important projects involving MathSwe directly.
