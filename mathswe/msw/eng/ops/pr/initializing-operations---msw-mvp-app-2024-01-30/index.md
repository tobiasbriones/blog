# Initializing Operations | Math Software MVP App (2024/01/30)

## Fast Paced Prototype

I started working on the app prototype in a single `index.html` file with the
styles I unofficially developed for MSW Engineer. I added upcoming styles and
some JS logic for the fractal animation with its special canvas parallax effect.

I (unofficially) deployed the prototypes to production and have been setting
priorities for the overwhelming projects, updates, and research I've had lately.

I'm urged to go to production since, as the founder, I need a return on my
investment after so much slack time in the past due to many other situations
that arise while growing as a professional. Thus, that's what I mean about
fixing priorities at this moment to trade minor tasks and projects behind for
the most important projects involving MathSwe directly.

## Drafting new Engineering Standards

In one of my next blog drafts, I'm adapting the **MVP (Minimum Viable
Project)[^1]** concept and introducing **Pre-Engineering Grade** as well as
granular variants of software quality that branch in two: General SWE and
Specialized SWE.

[^1]: I changed the popular "Product" noun of the acronym to "Project" since the
    underlying structures refer more to the technical organization of projects

These standards allow special software versioning and quality inference in a
scalable and rigorous way.

The draft's getting extremely large due to the formalities I'm devising against
my experience and knowledge of math and traditional engineering, so it will take
longer to publish.

The MVP and Pre-Engineering-Grade (I also call "the boundary") concepts have
priority for me now to move forward on the operational project side (i.e., ROI)
while enriching the mathematical side of MathSwe in the background.

Since I must go to production now, I'll be using MVPs for MSW and Repsymo to go
the right way.
