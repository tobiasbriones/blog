# Tagging Templates for Repetitive General-Purpose Projects (2024/09/20)

I have a problem where MathSwe must take (wrap) modular mathematical
applications to deploy them. For example, the Math Software app (pure) will need
a MathSwe final application to host it and become a tangible product in
production, so MathSweCom adds Cookie Consent with analytics ("business" side).
The direction goes from MSW to MathSwe, and both require the same web ceremony
for a monolith web application. How can they be reused like actual modules
*without overengineering*?

I've thought about microfrontends, but these would turn into over-engineering
right now and also require you to copy-paste the mundane project structure,
unlike microservices in the backend, where you have minimal overhead in a modern
language of your choice.

If you want microfrontends, it won't be the same as microservices. You can
choose Rust, Go, Kotlin, etc., to build a low-development-overhead microservice
right ahead. In the frontend, you only have JS, and you must set up TS on top of
JS ðŸ« , Vite/Webpack, and web structure. JS is the only idiotic ecosystem where
whenever you start a project, you always must replace it with another language
on top of it ðŸ¤¡. Further, I use functional libraries, like `fp-ts`, plus MathSwe
standard libraries (in the future), which only increase the development overhead
as the number of "micro" projects scale up. Consider that you can use Haskell
(i.e., no extra FP libraries) in the backend if you want, but the frontend is
limited to JS.

A microfrontend itself is a monolith with parts it will never use nor make sense
at all, like an `index.html` with `head` tags. So, you must repeat the same
"getting started" web bloat *every time* you create a "microfrontend."

Further, microfrontends require a "central monolith," and they have hidden
complexity, like downloading libraries multiple times. If you're not especially
*careful* and have multiple teams with big domain boundaries, I don't see
microfrontends as a feasible solution. Conversely, microservices (normal
programs instead of web bloat) can provide significant value earlier.

Creating microservices requires attention to your domain design, but **creating
microfrontends demands exceptional attention to all the design details**, and
they can easily have **the disadvantages of both monoliths and microfrontends**.
I should only consider microfrontends for huge enough and well-defined
application boundaries.

I also thought about creating a `fe-ops` CLI in Rust as scripting without
abstractions, but my needs are still unclear, and I have *many*
priorities. So, a CLI would also be overengineering.

Therefore, I'm opting for easier (probably simpler) solutions *at this
development stage*, like unifying templates to **remove inconsistencies among
projects**. So
[here's the template repository](https://github.com/mathswe-ops/templates)
where I will add project structures to have as a reference. Copy-pasting
templates seem dummy, but it's easy and might **provide value immediately**.

I can also employ prototypes for immediate solutions. Their advantage is that I
only add throw-away commits without formally developing and releasing products
with blogs and documentation. With prototypes, I can write whatever code I need
with zero responsibilities about formalities.

In short, I have many potential options, including:

- A repository with project templates to copy-paste from.
- A CLI to help with build steps.
- A prototype, like the "Texsydo Web prototype," to validate requirements.
- Designing microfrontends.

I will work with templates first to move on as fast as possible while
understanding the requirements better.

---

The repository I created will be for hosting any significant template to apply
to all projects as a base standard. I will include the template for a React +
TS + SWC + Vite + Vitest + Bootstrap web application. I will experiment in this
repository and will evolve the templates according to needs, considering them
as, at least, a temporary help.
