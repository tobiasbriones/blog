# Text Ops: New Add PR Command (2024/03/23)

## A New Major Project with MathSwe Text

I'll work on a new project to allow users to create MathSwe webpage articles
from an app that uses technologies similar to Markdown based on source code.

It may initially be advantageous in academia as a modern and domain-specific
software to avoid the burden and bloat of LaTeX or generic text editors like
Google Docs. The challenge is to standardize it as soon as possible since
considering breaking changes is not pretty feasible.

Previously, I published an update about a new tool to automate my work when
building articles in MSW Engineer, which is also helping to define standards.
Its name is `ops` for now, a CLI app that will evolve into the major project
SWAM (Special Software and Models), as published in
[Automating the Platform Operations and Beyond (2023/08/31)](/automating-the-platform-operations-and-beyond-2023-08-31).

The tool `ops` is still not published, and I've worked on it ad-hoc because of
legacy compatibility with Jekyll (a generic Markdown to static website generator
I'm slowly removing). Although there'll be a priority (in a few months or so)
for this project to officially standardize and publish it so it'll be available
for anyone.

I have to say I've been devising the name `text` when I publish the tooling
regarding "Markdown/DSL to Website," so it'll get deployed to the premium
subdomain text.math.software.

The constant implementations and innovations are getting MathSwe Text closer to
production to keep enriching the quality math products portfolio.
