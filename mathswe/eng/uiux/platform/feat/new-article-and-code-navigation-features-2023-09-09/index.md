## Article Navigation

The features for navigating inside articles is in production and recently
designed.

Article contents navigation is fundamental to moving among the tree of
homogeneous[^x] articles I create. This way, all this high-quality content
can be put together[^x].

[^x]: My articles are homogeneous since they have the *same* design, so I can
    **scale up** the whole content as I add more articles by letting the
    platform design principles **constant** (i.e., relativity)

[^x]: Recall the cohesion principle to build greater wholes

I finished polishing the so-called **ToC (Table of Contents)**[^x] feature this
time.

[^x]: I don't like using those commonly used generic terms you see from older
    computing and academia, like "table" of "contents," because it makes the
    articles more heterogeneous by using those repetitive stereotypes

From design, we have that an article is the same as its navigation, so both have
a different level of abstraction.

That is, **the article and its navigation are the same, but the nav is a resumed
version with only the headings or sections**[^x][^x].

[^x]: It's important to see my design view to conceptualize and understand the
    principle of homogeneity â€”both article and nav are the *same*, with
    *different* levels of abstraction or purpose

[^x]: It could also include other major navigation links like image or table
    captions

This well-designed navigation will start allowing readers to move smoothly among
the platform articles, so besides having great qualities already, now they're
also simpler and nice to browse with.
