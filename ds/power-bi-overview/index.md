# Power BI Overview

## Introduction

Organizations should own their data but also have a way to make proper use of 
them. Data are facts and with data science we can infer accurate reports 
about what's going on the organization.

There are many ways of analysing data, the most popular, say: Python 
libraries (Numpy and Pandas), the Julia programming language which is a 
niche for that domain, with help of notebooks that can document results with 
Markdown but run the code right there, even other popular programming 
languages like Kotlin, Java and C# are used for data analysis or similar 
applications. Needless to say, systems programming languages like Rust, C++ 
or C also take part into this adventure for high performance computations (e.
g. Python libraries so that Python is used as a C interface with easier 
syntax but the underlying code is written is C).
