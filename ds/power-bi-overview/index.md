# Power BI Overview

## Introduction

Organizations should own their data but also have a way to make proper use of
them. Data are facts and with data science we can infer accurate reports about
what's going on the organization.

There are many ways of performing data analysis, the most populars, say:

- Python libraries (Numpy and Pandas).
- The Julia programming language which is a niche for that domain.
- Jupyter Notebooks that can document results with Markdown but run the code
  right there.
- Even other popular programming languages like Kotlin, Java and C# are used for
  data analysis or similar applications.
- Needless to say, systems programming languages like Rust, C++ or C also take
  part into this adventure for high performance computations [^1].

[^1]: For example, Python libraries like Numpy are partly written in C so that
Python is used as a C interface with easier syntax but the underlying code is
written is C [6].

Moreover, those are technical ways of developing data science applications. For
end users, there are plenty of options too. One of the most populars are, of
course, Microsoft Power BI and Excel, and other competition like Tableau.

Power BI is a Microsoft 365 product that consists of apps and services to create
a powerful client for creating end users reports from data. Like any other
Microsoft product, it uses a binary format, so it's useful for end users to
understand their data rather than for data professionals.

Even though, Power BI is a tool aimed for office professionals, it still allows
a more advanced use for technical staff, but it is not require knowing. Using
Power BI is like using any other tool from the Microsoft Office suite. That
enables organization to quickly generate reports that may be deployed to the
web, the desktop or mobile.

### Data Driven Organization

According to *Building a Data-Driven Organization &vert; O’Reilly Media* [2] a
Data Driven Organization should have a culture to use data for decision-making,
the organization with the structure to support it and the technology that
supports it. The key is to develop that culture. Everything is data, for
literally any decision to take, use data as a fact to lead to that decision.

A problem with traditional organizations is requiring the so-called HIPPO
(Highest-Paid Person in the Office)
to make decisions [2]. Recall that you also need data permissions to acquire
them, so you usually depend on the HIPPO who will be far from good results,
that's a big problem for the data driven organization.

Everyone should use data in the organization so the results are more accurate,
and you can check your organization is data driven when data initiatives are
coming from the bottom of the hierarchy rather than the top or bureaucrats [2].

According to the *Five facts: How customer analytics boosts corporate
performance &vert; McKinsey* [7] survey, states that data-driven organizations
are 23 times more likely to acquire customers, 6.5 times as likely to retain
customers, and 18.8 times as likely to be profitable.
