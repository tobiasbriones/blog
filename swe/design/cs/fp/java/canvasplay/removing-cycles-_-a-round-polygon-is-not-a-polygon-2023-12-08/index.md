# Removing Cycles: a Round Polygon is Not a Polygon (2023/12/08)

## Vague Idea of a Round Rectangle

The popular idea of a round rectangle usually comes from taking a rectangle and
radius arcs to magically round or mutate its borders, which is far from correct.

### Round Rect in Canvas

The canvas APIs take raw primitives, so like the `fillRoundRect` method (and the
API itself analogously), take the top-left, width, and height (i.e., a
rectangle) and the arcs to soften it.

`Methods "fillRect", "fillRoundRect" of the JavaFX GraphicsContext API [2]`

```java
public void fillRect(
    double x,
    double y,
    double w,
    double h
) { /* ... */ }

public void fillRoundRect(
    double x,
    double y,
    double w,
    double h,
    double arcWidth,
    double arcHeight
) { /* ... */ }
```

Sure, the general-purpose canvas API (of HTML5, JavaFX, or whatever platform)
eats some `double` primitives, so it can make sense to say that a rectangle plus
some arcs ~~compose~~ a round rectangle.

This API *suggests that a round rectangle is the composition of a normal
rectangle and arcs,* which is wrong, but understandable in pragmatic terms.

The canvas API is lower-level (as it works with primitive values like `doable`),
so it takes less meaningful data types if at all â€”not to say it's inherently
mutable ðŸ˜¬â€”, so it's a misleading guide for high-level designs (though, powerful
for implementation details).

The interpretation that gives the canvas API is similar to one mathematical
definition of a round rectangle, but the issue with this model is that
the `w, h` arguments suggest a rectangle taking the whole lengths (i.e., more
than it is, so leaving out composition) when they should be `w - arcWidth / 2`,
and `h - arcHeight / 2` to *actually* denote an (inner) rectangle â€”albeit less
practical if using primitives.

That is, the `w, h` arguments are misleading since "rounded rectangles"
don't have width and height since they're not rectangles, but they have an inner
rectangle of `w - arcWidth / 2` times `h - arcHeight / 2` dimensions.

So, the canvas API is fine, but don't fall for the fake friends since primitive
values won't give the idea of high-level (mathematical) constructs.

### The Outer World

There are many more misleading definitions that apparently make sense but would
damage a system design if employed, not to say the very mathematical
definitions.

The above idea says that "Rounded rectangle **is** a rectangle," which is
totally wrong. It also dares to say that "rectangles can have **three
dimensions**" â€”also wrong.

It even gets weirder: "while rounded rectangles **canâ€™t**." So if a round
rectangle is a rectangle, why are "rectangles" 3D, but "round rectangles"
can't be?

Of course, those "definitions" make sense in their corresponding context or
software, but you see how they just pass unnoticed as if it were true.

You must pay close attention to all the details and particularly avoid falling
for banal non-mathematical ideas like the misleading "definitions" of a round
rectangle.
