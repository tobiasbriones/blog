# From Imperative to Functional: TypeScript Fetch Promise

![From Imperative to Functional: TypeScript Fetch Promise](from-imperative-to-functional-.-typescript-fetch-promise.png)

This
[gist](https://gist.github.com/tobiasbriones/544350fc301ffe32c1dd64d2f6ec6d81)
shows how more functional code is superior to imperative code to
perform a simple fetch request to get JSON value that models a tree data
structure to be represented later by `HTMLCanvasElement`.

Both versions are correct and do the same, the "functional" version still has
some imperative style because JS/TS is not a functional language but the
difference **is clear** again.
