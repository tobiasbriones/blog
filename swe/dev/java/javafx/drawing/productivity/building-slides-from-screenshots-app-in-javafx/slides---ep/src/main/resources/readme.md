# Resources

The app AI features requires the following contents into the `resources`
directory to work:

- Copy the `tessdata` directory from
  [tess4j \| GitHub](https://github.com/nguyenq/tess4j/tree/master/src/main/resources).
  Otherwise, the app will show the error `tessdata not found in the app
  resources directory`.

Copy the given contents here to this project's `resources` directory.
