# FP in Kotlin

I'll document particular insights about Kotlin functional designs I figure out.

This article keeps open to more sections to sub-publish.

## Pipe Operator

There's no support for the pipe operator `|>` in Kotlin, so we have to come by
with a custom and clean implementation for this function.

### Defining a Pipe Operator

Next, one consistent and clean implementation is given for a pipe operator in
Kotlin.

#### Finding a Suitable Symbol

First, I wanted to use the `|>` pipe symbol commonly used in functional
languages, but `>` is not a supported character: `Name contains illegal
characters: >`.

Then, I tried to use the other common `|` pipe symbol with no full success:
`Name contains characters which can cause problems on Windows: |`.

To avoid issues, I either had to design a simple symbol or use a verbose `pipe`
operator name.

So, I took my design from
[How I Standardized Hyphen and Pipe Symbols on File Names](how-i-standardized-hypen-and-pipe-symbols-on-file-names)
where I designed the standards for (among others) the pipe operator on file
names. Notice that file systems also require simple symbols to work with, so the
standard from my previous article was what I was looking for.

Now that **the pipe operator symbol is established to `---`**, the
implementation is next.

#### Language Features

It's required to employ:

- [Infix Functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/functions.html#infix-notation).
- [Lambdas](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html#lambdas).
- [Basic Generics](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/generics.html).

It's useful for the given example that shows the operator usage:

- [Data Classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/data-classes.html).
- [Value Classes](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/inline-classes.html).
- [String Interpolation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html#string-interpolation).
- [Basic Regex](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.text/to-regex.html).

#### Operator Definition

First, the `---` operator is defined:

`Pipe.kt`

```kotlin
infix fun <X, Y> X.`---`(f: (X) -> Y): Y = f(this)
```

<figcaption>
<p align="center"><strong>Definition of the Pipe ("---") Operator</strong></p>
</figcaption>

Where:

- `---` is a special function name escaped within backticks "``" that
  **denotes the "pipe operator"** as described before.
- Two generics `X` and `Y` are defined to **represent the LHS and RHS** of the
  operator.
- The `infix` notation is used on the extension function `---` defined for all
  $$x \in X$$. There are two parts here:
    - The **extension function**.
    - The **infix which provides the syntax sugar**.
- $$\forall x \in X, y \in Y$$, the lambda `f: (X) -> Y` is defined as the
  **operator argument**. So, we have:
    - The constant (LHS) is given by $$X$$.
    - The function (RHS) to be applied is given by $$f:X \to Y$$.
- `---` **returns** `Y` â€”result of applying $$f$$ to some $$x$$.
- `---`'s **image is defined as `f(this)`** where `this` is an element of `X`.

That was the definition of the pipe operator.

#### Usage Example

Now, to address a concrete example to use this new feature, I implemented a
basic DSL for an `Article` domain type.

`Pipe.kt`

```kotlin
data class Article(val title: Title, val content: String)

@JvmInline
value class Title(val value: String) {
    override fun toString(): String = value
}

val title: (String) -> Title = { Title(it) }
```

<figcaption>
<p align="center"><strong>Definition of an "Article" DSL</strong></p>
</figcaption>

So, to test the code, I will add a user input title that is not cleaned, some
content, and I'll also define more functions with **transformations**, so we can
*pipe them*.

`fun main | Pipe.kt`

```kotlin
val inputTitle = "FP in Kotlin: Defining a Pipe   Operator  "
val inputContent = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..."
```

<figcaption>
<p align="center"><strong>Sample User Input for Example Snippet</strong></p>
</figcaption>

Then, we'll have some useful example transformations:

`fun main | Pipe.kt`

```kotlin
val clean: (String) -> String = { it.trim().replace("\\s+".toRegex(), " ") }
val uppercase: (String) -> String = { it.uppercase() }
val markdownTitle: (String) -> String = { "# $it" }
val formatTitle: (String) -> String =
    { it `---` clean `---` uppercase `---` markdownTitle }
```

<figcaption>
<p align="center"><strong>Transformations for Example Snippet</strong></p>
</figcaption>

Finally, we can create an `Article` with `title` and `content`:

`fun main | Kotlin.kt`

```kotlin
print(
    Article(
        inputTitle `---` formatTitle `---` title,
        inputContent
    )
)
```

<figcaption>
<p align="center"><strong>Building an "Article" for the Example 
Snippet</strong></p>
</figcaption>

With this, a title `String` can be transformed into a `Title` domain type by
piping it to the transformations declared:

- In `formatTitle`: `clean`, `uppercase`, `markdownTitle`.
- Then (in a higher-level view), applying `formatTitle` to the raw `String`
  input and transforming this value into a `Title` via the constructor `title`:
  `inputTitle `---` formatTitle `---` title`.

The program's output is:

```
Article(
    title=# FP IN KOTLIN: DEFINING A PIPE OPERATOR,
    content=Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
)
```

<figcaption>
<p align="center"><strong>Program's Output (Formatted)</strong></p>
</figcaption>

The example code is [here](kotlin/Pipe.kt).

#### Functional Language Design

Notice that we're using backticks "``" to define the `infix` operator like
functional languages like Purescript do and
[employ this feature](https://leanpub.com/purescript/read#leanpub-auto-infix-operators).
It's also preferred to use normal identifier names (i.e., alphabetic) instead of
predefined symbols (e.g., `+`) to avoid *abusing the syntax*[^1][^2][^3].

[^1]: A fear of Java architects has been the potential abuse of operator
    overloading 

[^2]: Despite being a trivial feature to add (syntax sugar), Java will probably
    never have operator overloading

[^3]: It's, of course, tackled elegantly in purely functional languages which
    build DSLs, as said before

As said above, the pipe can be commonly denoted by `|` or `|>`. Since `pipe` is
a universally abstract concept, it must be **terse**, so defining a
**symbol** for it is a good design. For user-specific languages, alphabetic
identifiers should be used, as said above.

#### Custom Pipe in Kotlin

This was the design of a custom pipe operator that can be used in Kotlin, and
some insights about functional languages as well.

### Options for a Pipe Operator in Kotlin

As developed before, we faced many constraints in Kotlin for getting a language
design that enables us to use the pipe operator. So, we have open possibilities
to add this feature to our codebase, and
[I developed one ("---")](#defining-a-pipe-operator) that keeps consistent with
the newest MathSwe standards I had defined before.

## Designing Functional Languages in Kotlin

With Kotlin, DSLs can be designed via its functional language features that I
keep updating in this article when I face them that build an engineering
standard for this language so it can be employed for some of the development of
mathematical software.
